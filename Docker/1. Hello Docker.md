## Hello Docker

#### What is Docker?

> Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a **container**. The isolation and security allow you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight because they don’t need the extra load of a hypervisor, but run directly within the host machine’s kernel. This means you can run more containers on a given hardware combination than if you were using **virtual machines**. You can even run Docker containers within host machines that are actually virtual machines! [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)
